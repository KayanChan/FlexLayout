            <div class="cell">Life pressures and modern electronics are taking away our time for conversation. "Just scan the QR code/open the app and you can enjoy our service. "Handwritten menus are being replaced by interactive ordering systems that don't require you to say a word to communicate your needs; Digital maps have taken the place of asking passers-by for directions and having to interpret their gesticulations; Electronic payment is taking over from cash, meaning you never have to wait for change or hear the shopkeeper say that they've run out.</div>
            <div class="cell">Do any of the situations listed above sound familiar? Or maybe you spend a day as follows: As the working day begins, clicking and typing are the main office sounds you hear, alongside the hum of the air conditioner, a clattering fan and somebody coughing… Everyone stares at their computer screens and moves their fingers quickly, either typing or using a mouse. Your manager assigns the day's tasks via a WeChat group. You receive a WeChat message from your colleague who   sat in the next cubicle. "Could I borrow your USB cable? Mine's at home." You turn around, give her the cable with smile and turn back to continue your work. Finally, it's time to leave the office. You stretch and start walking toward the subway station. When you get to security, there's a voice in your ear saying "please remove any liquids for testing". You don't answer, but do as you're told. As you approach your home, you spot some fresh fruit for sale. You step into the store, pick something out and put it on the scale. "6.5 yuan," says the cashier. You scan the payment code and leave. </div>
